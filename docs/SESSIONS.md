# Session log

## 2026-09-28 — Session 001

- Time: see the timestamp immediately below (Europe/Warsaw).
- Goal: bootstrap the lab and verify one small agent-handoff experiment.
- Observed problem: a new agent can trust notes based on changed files; this
  workspace also began without a checkout. Remote repo contained only README.
- Changes: implemented capture/check CLI, strict JSON handling and path checks,
  deterministic output, operating rules, hypothesis roadmap and continuity docs.
- Changed files: README.md, AGENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, .gitignore,
  src/ai_for_ai_lab/{__init__.py,__main__.py,capsule.py}, tests/test_capsule.py,
  docs/{CAPSULE.md,DECISIONS.md,SESSIONS.md}.
- Tests: `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — 11 passed.
  Covers byte edits with equal size, deletion, timestamp-only change, unchanged
  evidence, path traversal, symlink substitution, directory replacement, invalid
  documents, duplicate JSON keys, deterministic capture and CLI exits 0/1/2.
- Result: selected local evidence changes are detected; invalid inputs do not
  produce a fresh result. This does not establish recovery gains for real LLMs.
- Learned: byte identity provides a useful narrow check, but cannot validate
  an agent's conclusion. Tool-discovery output itself can waste context.
- Decisions: DEC-0001, DEC-0002, DEC-0003. General memory DB and UI postponed.
- Unresolved: no claim-specific dependencies, semantic checks, concurrent-write
  protection, external sources, or benchmark evidence of task/token improvement.
- Exact next step: create deterministic fixtures for unchanged/edited/deleted/
  unrelated edit; benchmark a blind-trust baseline against capsule checking;
  emit JSON counts of detected stale cases and unnecessary invalidations, add
  assertions for expected counts, and document limitations of this synthetic test.
- Session recorded: 2026-09-28T18:12:16+02:00
- Infrastructure finding: HTTPS clone succeeded, but shell `git push` failed
  because no shell GitHub credentials were available. Use the authenticated
  GitHub connector's tree/commit/ref operations to publish the tested tree;
  never copy tokens into git config, files, or logs.
